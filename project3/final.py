#Project 4
#For Project 4, I have decided to explore Gmail's API. I plan to collect 100 emails and analyze the days that the interactions took place. I will then write the data to the database (using SQL). I will analyze the data from the database using the Pandas library of Python to create a graph  Then, I will use this data to create a report that shows how active I am on Gmail. My goal for this project is to analyze data to see what day I am most active on Gmail is. I will follow this same procedure to find what day I am most active on Instagram - by collecting 100 Instagram posts and analyze the days that the interactions took place. Lastly, I will do the same with Spotify - I will collect 100 followers of Frank Ocean and analyze what days
